Typically a model with fixed budget and flexible scope works best. If you have a stable team this also allows you to say roughly when it will be done, since you can calculate when the budget is gone. But neither you nor the client will know exactly what will be delivered in the end. The good thing is that you can be very flexible to change during the project, and will likely deliver a better product. Also keep everything as small and simple as possible, and deliver working software to the customer as often as possible so you can adjust course (agile 101). :slightly_smiling_face:","channel":"C0DV0F5ME","user":"U5M2BMSTB","type":"message","ts":"1501486521.837756","icons":{},"team":"T09C8HPAQ"},{"text":"To clarify - are you changing the priority of things the team committed to in the sprint?

Some argue waterfall is actually easier to manage in these setups. I don\'t have a solution but one that has worked for us before is selling only a small piece of work to begin with (easier to scope manage etc) after which if the client is happy you can build on that selling more continuous small chunks of work. This allows you to run a more lean prod dev workflow where you deliver small pieces of value and the breath of scope is not mindboggling.

We usually tried split clients idea to smaller parts (in mobile app usually screens) and estimate how long it might take each one. At the end we added 30% of time for bug fixes, clients changes etc.  Then we presented it to client, sometimes we were suggesting that maybe it will be better to start with MVP, something smaller, validate idea first. But clients are stubborn, so sometimes is hard to persuade them to change scope. So we end up with prices for whole project, and from my perspective, fixed price model (you estimate at beginning, calculate cost, show cost to client and sign contract with that price) is one of the most dangerous models for software house. Estimations are super hard, working with clients also. They change mind, sometimes share idea not clearly, sometimes for them description means quite opposite then for everybody else. I highly recommend using per working hour rate. So you can present to client that \xe2\x80\x9cthis project will cost 300 working hours, our rate is 30$ per hour, it will cost around 9000$, but this price might be lower or higher depending how development process will proceed, how many updates and changes you will request\xe2\x80\x9d. Then you give to client full insight how your team burns working hours and this changes his approach.
